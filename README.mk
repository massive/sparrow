Framejob
========

Simple node.js chat server and/or application framework.

The purpose of this application is to learn node.js, not necessarily to do the best framework ever.

** Note: This is work in progress **

Usage
-----



TODO
--------
* Extract the core framework from the chat application
* Add persistence layer (probably Redis based)
* Add tests
