Sparrow - Simple Chat for Node.js
=======================

Simple node.js chat server and/or application framework.

The purpose of this application is to learn node.js, not necessarily to do the best framework ever.

** Note: This is work in progress **

Usage

Goals
-----
* Simple SSO for integrating existing systems into chat
* 

TODO for Sparrow
----------------
* Extract the core framework from the chat application
* Add persistence (probably Redis based models)
* Add tests
* Sessions
* Chat rooms
* IRC-like command (/who, /join, /nick etc.)

* DELETE and PUT requests
* params('param') instead of params.param
* this.render instead of request.render
